# Incident Response Report: NIST Cybersecurity Framework

This repository contains a structured incident response analysis based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The analysis was conducted as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** course on Coursera.

## ðŸ“Œ Scenario Summary

A multimedia company experienced a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack targeting its internal network. The attacker exploited an unconfigured firewall to flood the network with ICMP packets, which caused a two-hour outage.

The analysis in this report applies the NIST CSF to break down the incident across five key areas:

- **Identify** â€“ Recognizing vulnerabilities and critical assets
- **Protect** â€“ Implementing firewall rules and best practices
- **Detect** â€“ Using network monitoring and traffic pattern analysis
- **Respond** â€“ Mitigating the incident and filtering malicious traffic
- **Recover** â€“ Restoring services and strengthening defenses

## ðŸ“‚ Files

  A detailed application of the NIST framework to the scenario.

## ðŸ›  Skills Demonstrated

- Incident analysis
- Firewall and network protection
- Application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Technical writing and documentation

## ðŸ“š Background

This exercise was part of a graded portfolio activity designed to reinforce real-world security response practices. It contributes to my goal of becoming a **Security Analyst**
